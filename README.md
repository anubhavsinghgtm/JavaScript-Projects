## Overview
### Color Flipper
It is a beginner JS web application project where a user can change the background color of the page randomly. There are two interfaces one where you can direclty change the color based on name and in other interface you can change color as per the hex code mentioned in the js file.

### Counter
We have a counter in between and there is three option where one can increase, decrease or reset the counter to 0. If the counter is a positive number it's color become green. if the counter is negative then it turns to red and it is black while having value 0.

### Review
We have a card of review from the different people. There we have two buttons for reading the previous and next review while there is a surprise me button which present the random review to the user.

### Navbar Toggle
In this project I have created a responsive navigation menu for desktop and mobile version. Javascript is used to toggle(add and remove) the class required for different different device viewport. 

#### desktop version

### Sidebar
This project is very similar to navbar toggle where I have created a sidebar. The sidebar will cover 40% of space on bigger screen while 100% on smaller screen.

### Modal
This is a very famous activity of frontend where we can open a modal by clicking on the button. On a single click you can view the modal and there is a close button on the modal to close the modal easily.

### Questions
In this project I have created an interface where you can toggle the view on clicking. It's a great facility that you can use in your FAQs to maintain the UI spaces.

### Scroll sticky header
This is a useful project where one can use scroll method to make the header sticky and same time apply some changes while scrolling. It is also kept in mind that the page should be mobile friendly and work on smaller as well as big screens.

![sticky-header](https://github.com/anubhavsinghgtm/JavaScript-Projects/blob/2ae4ef3c51805903c953d04cc4a6b4de21de910e/Scroll/Screenshots/sticky%20header.jpg)


### Tabs
Here we have four different tabs with different data. We can switch over any tabs smoothly. This is very useful to present a large piece of contnet in a small space.

### Countdown
Here we can set a deadline and there will be a countdown that runs every second.
